Dev Prerelease Workflow
=======================

The repository ships dev builds straight from the `dev` branch. Every push you make to `dev` now triggers a single workflow (`.github/workflows/dev-prerelease.yml`) that bumps the version, builds all artifacts, and publishes a GitHub prerelease.

Flow
----

1. You push commits to `dev`.  
   The workflow bumps `version.env` by incrementing the patch number, stamps `PRERELEASE=dev.<short-sha>`, commits the change, and tags the commit (`v<version>-dev.<sha>`).

2. The build matrix compiles the launcher for Linux, Windows, and macOS, including the WiX-based MSI.

3. A prerelease is created on GitHub using the new tag, and all artifacts from the build matrix are attached automatically.

Key files
---------

- `.github/workflows/dev-prerelease.yml` – orchestrates the bump, build, and release steps.  
- `version.env` – generated by CI; do not edit by hand.  
- `scripts/build-installer.ps1` – invoked on Windows to bake version info into the MSI.

Operational notes
-----------------

- The workflow skips itself when the actor is `github-actions[bot]` to avoid loops from the CI commit/tag push.  
- If you need to pause automated prereleases, disable the workflow or protect the `dev` branch.  
- Manual version overrides can be done with `scripts/bump-version.ps1`, but the next push will replace them, so prefer letting CI manage `version.env`.
