# Security Review - TheBoys Launcher

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive security review of TheBoys Launcher, covering potential vulnerabilities and security measures implemented.

## Security Assessment Summary

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures
1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated before processing
   - Path traversal protection implemented
   - File name sanitization for dangerous characters
   - URL validation for network requests

2. **File System Security**
   - Restricted file access within designated directories
   - Path traversal prevention using `std::path::Path` validation
   - Safe file operations with proper error handling

3. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement for external requests
   - User agent validation
   - Request timeout configurations
   - Proper SSL/TLS certificate validation

4. **Error Handling**
   - No sensitive information leaked in error messages
   - Consistent error handling throughout the application
   - Proper logging without exposing sensitive data

### üîí Security Considerations

#### 1. File Operations
**Risk**: Path traversal attacks, unauthorized file access
**Mitigation**:
- Implemented `is_valid_filename()` function in `src-tauri/src/utils/file.rs:101`
- Path validation in all file operations
- Restricted to user-writable directories

#### 2. Network Requests
**Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, malicious servers
**Mitigation**:
- HTTPS-only requests in `src-tauri/src/utils/network.rs:8`
- Certificate validation
- Request timeouts (30 seconds)

#### 3. Code Execution
**Risk**: Arbitrary code execution through Java/Minecraft launching
**Mitigation**:
- Validated Java paths and versions
- Restricted command arguments
- No shell injection vulnerabilities

#### 4. Data Storage
**Risk**: Sensitive data exposure in configuration files
**Mitigation**:
- No passwords or tokens stored in plain text
- Configuration files stored in user directory only
- Proper file permissions

## Security Tests

### 1. Input Validation Tests
```rust
// Test path traversal attempts
let malicious_paths = vec![
    "../../../etc/passwd",
    "..\\..\\windows\\system32\\config\\sam",
    "/etc/shadow",
];

// Test injection attempts
let malicious_inputs = vec![
    "'; DROP TABLE settings; --",
    "<script>alert('xss')</script>",
    "$(rm -rf /)",
];
```

### 2. File System Security Tests
```rust
// Test directory traversal prevention
// Test file name sanitization
// Test permission validation
```

### 3. Network Security Tests
```rust
// Test HTTPS enforcement
// Test timeout configurations
// Test certificate validation
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Application only accesses necessary directories
- No elevated privileges required
- Sandboxed Tauri environment

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of input validation
- Error handling at all levels
- Secure by default configuration

### 3. Secure Defaults
- No auto-execution of downloaded files
- User confirmation required for dangerous operations
- Safe directory defaults

## Potential Security Improvements

### 1. Code Signing
- [ ] Implement code signing for releases
- [ ] Verify integrity of downloaded files

### 2. Additional Validation
- [ ] Hash verification for downloaded files
- [ ] Digital signature verification for modpacks

### 3. Network Hardening
- [ ] Implement certificate pinning
- [ ] Add request rate limiting

### 4. Runtime Security
- [ ] Enable ASLR and DEP
- [ ] Implement control flow integrity

## Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Input validation implemented
- [x] Path traversal protection
- [x] HTTPS enforcement
- [x] Error handling without information leakage
- [x] Safe file operations
- [x] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] Proper session management

### üîÑ In Progress

- [ ] Formal threat modeling

## Vulnerability Scanning

### Static Analysis
- Use `cargo-audit` for Rust dependencies
- Use `npm audit` for Node.js dependencies
- Regular security updates

### Dynamic Analysis
- Fuzzing for file parsing
- Network protocol testing
- Resource exhaustion testing

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Reporting
- Private issue reporting on GitHub
- Security contact: security@theboyslauncher.com
- Responsible disclosure policy

### Response Procedures
1. Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. Initial assessment within 48 hours
3. Fix development based on severity
4. Coordinate disclosure timeline
5. Deploy patches and updates

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- No personal data collection without consent
- Local data storage only
- No telemetry or analytics by default

### Open Source Security
- All security-related code is open source
- Community review encouraged
- Transparent security practices

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. Keep the launcher updated
2. Only download from trusted sources
3. Use antivirus software
4. Review permissions carefully

### For Developers
1. Regular security reviews
2. Dependency updates
3. Security testing in CI/CD
4. Security training

## Conclusion

TheBoys Launcher implements comprehensive security measures to protect users from common vulnerabilities. The application follows security best practices and includes multiple layers of protection. Regular security reviews and updates are essential to maintain security posture.

**Security Rating**: üü¢ Good (No critical vulnerabilities found)

**Next Review Date**: 6 months from last update or after major changes
