# TheBoys Launcher

A cross-platform, modern GUI Minecraft modpack launcher built with Go and Wails.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Currently in Development - Phase 3: Core Logic Implementation**

This is a complete rebuild of the original TheBoys Launcher, transforming it from a Windows-only TUI application to a cross-platform GUI with proper architecture.

## âœ… Completed Features

### Phase 1: Project Architecture âœ…
- Cross-platform project structure
- Wails v2 GUI framework integration
- Modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Legacy code preservation in `/legacy` folder

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure âœ…
- **Platform Abstraction**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based settings with validation
- **Logging System**: Structured logging with rotation and multiple outputs
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type definitions
- **Basic GUI**: Functional application with modern interface

## ðŸš§ In Progress

### Phase 3: Core Launcher Logic
- [ ] Modpack management system
- [ ] Java runtime detection and management
- [ ] Prism Launcher integration
- [ ] Instance management

## ðŸ“‹ Planned Features

### Phase 4: GUI Development
- Modern, responsive user interface
- Modpack selection and management UI
- Settings and configuration panels
- Progress indicators and status updates
- Dark/light theme support

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish
